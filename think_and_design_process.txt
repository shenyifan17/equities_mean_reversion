Design and thinking behind this project: 

Background: Use SPX constituents data to design a mean reversion pairs trading
strategy. I haven't spent time on mean reversion/stats arb strategy before, below is some quick research/learning and thoughts 

-  Initial thought is to run rolling correlation matrices and select the pairs with highest correlation. 
   Potentially cleaning the correlation matrices by using Random Matrix Theory (removing eigenvalues below certian threshold and then reconstruct the correlation matrix)
-  However only using correlation might lead to false conclusion, using cointegration
-  Then naturally the idea becomes running correlation first, and running cointegration among the most correlated pairs for pairs selection
-  Then re-scale the spread using linear regression and obtain beta
        One problem (as many other systematic strategies using look back window is that the beta determination is too regid as the look back window is fixed )
        Solution is to use Kalman Filter to keep obtain new information adjust the beta 
- In terms of exection, the most vanilla approach is to consider how much standard deviation the adjusted spread is away from the mean 
  Then execute when the adjusted spread passes the entry level, close the position when the adjusted spread converged to 0

- The Cartesian product of all the parameter combinations are tested, statistics are plotted using an interactive heatmap. The idea of a successful strategy is 
  that the overall performances/statistics are not sensitive to paramters pertubation, and the heatmap should be stable
